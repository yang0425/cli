For this script to work it needs some configurations:

  1. Install 1Password command line tool
  2. Install jq
  3. Your 1Password's password saved into KeyChain app
  4. Assistive permissions for your terminal

Scroll down to STEP-TESTING if you already know how to configure.

CONFIGURATION

1) Install 1Password command line tool 

Follow the tutorial from https://support.1password.com/command-line-getting-started/

2) Install jq

brew install jq

3) Using KeyChain to save your password

On OS X (your Mac) there's an application called 'KeyChain Access' usually
under the directory 'Applications/Utilities', this is where all your passwords
and sensitive information is saved.

You need to open this application and add your password to it so that is safe
and can be used by this script to retrieve your password. It's a simple process.

a) Open our KeyChain Access application
b) Click on the '+' sign at the lower left
c) Fill 'Key Chain Item Name' with 'oppw'
d) Fill 'Account Name' with your 1Password's username
e) Fill the 'Password' field with your 1Password's password

4) Assistive permissions for your terminal

In order to click in windows and read the results you need to grant assistive
permissions. Go to your System Preferences -> Security -> Privacy -> Accessibility
and ensure that your Terminal application (if you use iTerm, then
you need to add the iTerm app) is added to the list and it is checked.
If you see an error like when trying to connect:

62:115: execution error: System Events got an error: osascript is not allowed assistive access. (-10006)

It probably means that you didn't add your Terminal to the Accessibility list.

STEP-TESTING

1) Ensure your 1Password command line tool have been installed.

op --version

2) Ensure jq have been installed

jq --version

3) Ensure your password is saved in KeyChain and can be retrieved.
